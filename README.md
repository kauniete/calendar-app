# calendar-app
A task I did for a company in order to qualify for a front-end development internship
Only HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, no frameworks etc allowed
I used sessionStorage to store data (it was a requirement) 

Features:
• Month view is populated with month data (days, events)
• It is possible to change to another year/month views
• It is possible to create an event, which adds to the calendar view right away
• Event details may be viewed upon click on the event title
• Event can be deleted

P.S. Developed and tested only on the Chrome browser
